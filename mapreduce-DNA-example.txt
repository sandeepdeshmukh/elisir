||Problem Statement||
=====================
Some important terms::
    DNA : stores biological information
    Genes : Functional unit made up of the DNA. (Humans have 20-25K genes)
    Chromosome : Genes collectively form the chromosome (Humans have 25 chromosomes)
    Genome: Chromosomes collectively form the human genome.

Now, when sequencing of human genome is done, the genome is not sequenced from
its start to its end in one stretch...., as it is not possible!! The process of 
sequencing involves following steps:

1. Chop the entire genome (all chormosomes) into fragments (each of about 50-500 in length)
2. Perform sequencing of each of the fragment
3. Once individual fragment is sequenced then map the fragments to a reference genome
4. Find out the locations where each fragment maps (i.e. on which chromosome & at what position)
5. Identify fragments which map to a single chromosome and save them together
6. Create such files for all chromosomes so that those files can be processed by downstream algorithms
7. The overall process is called as "MAPPING"

We need to solve this problem of sequencing using Map-Reduce framework.

INPUT:
======
A file containing random strings of length around 50.
You can use below command to create the input file:

for i in `seq 1 1000`; do echo $RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM | tr '[0-9]' 'ACGTACGTA' >> /tmp/random-strings.txt ; done


You need to write below function in map:
----------------------------------------
Consider that each of the strings from the input file map to one of the 25 
reference strings (chromosomes) and you get the exact mapping position from 
a pre-defined function. The function returns a chromosome number and the 
position at which the random string matches.
e.g.
Random String: ATCGCTAGCTAGGCGGCTAGATAGATCGCTAGATCGCTAGCTAGCTACGA
Return value from function: (chr4, 7212)

First value (CHROMOSOME) is within range: chr1 to chr25
Second value (POSITION) is in the range: 1 to 999999

Note that,
FOR SIMPLICITY, currently, there is no relationship between random string 
and the return value from the above function. Whatever the string is, return 
value from function has no relation with it.


FINAL OUTPUT:
=============
You need to create a file per CHROMOSOME:
i.e. chr1.txt, chr2.txt, chr3.txt, ................., chr24.txt, chr25.txt

Each file will contain the output in the format specified below. Note that,
the per chromosome output is sorted by the POSITION value.

chr1.txt:
---------
12      ATATCGATATCGCTAGCTAGGCGGCTAGATAGATCGCTAGATCGCTAGCT
101     AGCTACGACGCTAGCTAGGCGGCTAGATAGATCGCTAGATCGCTAGCTAG
1234    CTACGACATCGCTAGCTAGGCGGCTAGATAGATCGCTAGATCGCTAGCTA
74593   GCTACGATAATCGCTAGCTAGGCGGCTAGATAGATCGCTAGATCGCTAGC
...

234566  TAGCTACGAGCTAGGCGGCTAGATAGATCGCTAGATCGCTAGCTAGCTAC
998877  GACGCTAGCTAGGCGGCTAGATAGATCGCTAGATCGCTAGCTAGCTACGA
